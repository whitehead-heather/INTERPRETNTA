The run sequence plots generated by INTERPRET NTA are scatter plots which show the relative abundance of user-input tracer chemicals across a sample sequence. Run sequence plots are generated using data from (1) the input detection file(s), (2) run sequence file(s), and (3) tracer file. Interactive run sequence plots may be accessed by clicking on “Load Results” and selecting the “Run Sequence Plot” option. Once loaded, the run sequence plot(s) should populate as shown in **Figure XX** below.
