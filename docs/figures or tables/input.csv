Input matrix non-detect value:,"Open text field input. Should be the number or character that represents all non-detects in the input negative and positive mode files. (e.g., “0” if all non-detect cells have a 0, or a empty call if all non-detect cells are empty)",
Discard features below this RT (mins):,Open text field input. This limits the features of interest by removing all features below the designated retention time and is directly related to the void volume/time of the analytical method used to acquire sample data,0
Positive mode adducts:,"Selection boxes that allows users to select which adduct forms should be searched for in features in the detection matrix. Possible adduct forms are [M+Na]+, [M+NH4]+, [M+K]+",
Negative mode adducts:,"Selection boxes that allows users to select which adduct forms should be searched for in features in the detection matrix. Possible adduct forms are [M+Cl]-, [M+HCO2]-, [M+CF3CO2]-, [M+Br]-, [M+CH3CO2]-, and [M+FA]-",
Neutral losses:,Selection boxes that allow users to select neutral losses that should be searched for in features in the detection matrix. Various neutral losses are provided,"[M-H2O], [M-CO2]"
Adduct / duplicate mass accuracy units:,"Drop-down box with ""ppm"" or ""Da"". This box allows users to select the units of mass tolerance for adduct and duplicate feature identification. The exact mass tolerance is set in the next option below",ppm
Adduct / duplicate mass accuracy:,Open text field input. This should be the numeric value that defines the mass tolerance for adduct and duplicate feature identification. The number given should conform to the units chosen above,10
Adduct /duplicate RT accuracy (mins):,Open text field input. This should be a numeric value that defines the retention time tolerance for adduct and duplicate feature identification. This tolerance is the window of retention times in which a feature can be considered an adduct or duplicate of another feature,0.05
Tracer mass accuracy units:,"Drop-down box with ""ppm"" or ""Da"". This box allows users to select the units of mass tolerance for tracer feature identification. The exact mass tolerance is set in the next option below",ppm
Tracer mass accuracy:,Open text field input. This should be the numeric value that defines the mass tolerance for tracer identification. The number given here should be with respect to the units chosen above,5
Tracer RT accuracy (mins):,Open text field input. This should be a numeric value that defines the retention time tolerance for tracer feature identification. This tolerance is the window of retention times in which a feature can be found to be considered a tracer based on the tracer input file,0.1
Tracer plot y-axis scaling:,Drop-down box with “log” or “linear”. This controls the scale used for the y-axis of the tracer run sequence plots,log
Tracer plot trendlines shown:,Drop-down box with “yes” or “no”. This controls whether the tracer run sequence plots include trendlines for the response of the tracer within each sample group,yes
Min replicate hits (%):,Sliding bar of integers. These are numeric values that represent the percentage of sample replicates in which a feature must be observed to be considered a sample occurrence,66
Min replicate hits in blanks (%):,Sliding bar of integers. These are numeric values that represent the percentage of blank replicates in which a feature must be observed to be considered a blank occurrence,66
Max replicate CV:,Open text field input. This should be a numeric value representing the maximum acceptable CV across sample and blank replicates. Any occurrences with CV values greater than the maximal acceptable CV are flagged in the output data,0.8
MRL standard deviation multiplier:,"Drop-down box with “3”, “5”, or “10”. The MRL for each feature represents the “minimum reporting level”. It is calculated as the mean blank abundance plus the standard deviation that has been multiplied by this scalar value. Assuming that blank detection abundances for any feature are normally distributed, multiplier values of 3, 5, and 10 allow approximation of the upper (one-tailed) 97.5th, 99.5th, and 99.9th percentile of the blank abundance distribution (assuming five replicates)",3
Parent ion mass accuracy (ppm):,Sliding bar of integers. These are numeric values that represent the mass tolerance (in ppm) used to search the estimated monoisotopic masses of features against exact masses of MS-ready structures in the Distributed Structure-Searchable Toxicity (DSSTox). database,5
Search DSSTox for possible structures:,Yes/no drop down. This allows users to choose if they want the masses of features that pass QA/QC filtering to be searched against the DSSTox database to identify candidate chemical matches,Yes
Search Cheminformatics Hazard Module:,Yes/no drop down. This allows users to choose if you want the candidate chemicals from DSSTox to have metadata returned from the Cheminformatics Hazard Module,No
Search DSSTox by:,"Drop down menu that allows users to choose between ""mass"" (default) and ""formula"". When mass is selected, the masses of features that pass QA/QC are used to search the DSSTox database. When formula is selected, the molecular formula for features that pass QA/QC are used to search DSSTox. Note: a formula search requires the user to submit input files that have a “formula” column included",Mass
