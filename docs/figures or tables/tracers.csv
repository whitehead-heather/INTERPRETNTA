Required column ,Acceptable column names,Description of column contents,Additional comments
Name,Chemical_Name,"An identifier given for a chemical. Can be an IUPAC name, general name, acronym, or other unique identifier ",
Ionization mode,Ionization_Mode,The ionization mode for which a tracer is expected to be observed as a feature. Should be given as either “ESI-” or “ESI+”,"When a tracer is amenable to both ESI+ and ESI-, and data from both modes are included as input detection matrices, that tracer should present twice in the outputs files, with one entry per ionization mode"
Mass,Monoisotopic_Mass,"The exact mass of a tracer. This value should have an appropriate number of decimal places relative to the measurement technique (e.g., at least four for HRMS data)","Ensure compatibility between mass provided in input detection matrices and tracer files. Certain tracers may be best monitored by searching for adducts or alternative ion forms instead of the addition or subtraction of a proton (e.g., GenX is a PFAS that is typically monitored as [M-H-CO2]-). If adducts and other ion forms have not been accounted for in the input detection matrices, the tracer exact mass values may need to be adjusted accordingly"
Retention time,Retention_Time,"The measured retention time of a tracer. This value should be given in units of minutes and have an appropriate number of decimal places relative to the measurement technique (e.g., one or two for LC data)",The retention times given here should be reflective of the expected retention time based on previous method experience or validation
