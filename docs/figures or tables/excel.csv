Sheet name,Description of contents,Additional comments
Analysis Parameters,Displays the user-selected or defined parameters used to run INTERPRET NTA. This includes the names of input files and the exact values of thresholds used for future refence,
All Detection Statistics ,"Displays the original input detection matrix list with features (as rows) that were present in the input file and all the original columns included in the original input file (mass, RT, peak area in individual samples, any pass-through columns). It is important to note that this sheet does not reduce/replace any input feature or sample-level information (e.g. which features are present and their peak areas in samples) Additional columns have been added to this sheet that report: 1) Max CV across the feature, 2) Calculated MRL (using the selected multiplier, and at each of 3x, 5x, and 10x multipliers), 3) Whether the feature was identified as a duplicate, adduct, or neutral loss of another feature, and 4) Individual sample replicate stats like mean, median, standard deviation, CV, and detection counts and frequency.",Appended with the ionization mode (Neg) or (Pos)
Tracer Detection Statistics,"Displays any tracers that were identified in the data based on the input tracer file given by the user. This sheet contains information about the observed feature (mass, retention time) as well as the difference of the identified feature to the values given in the input file (mass difference, RT difference). This sheet also reports the response of each identified feature across samples. ",Peak areas reported on this sheet are completely unmodified and match what would be found in the input detection matrix.Any tracers that were in the input tracer file that did not have a matching feature identified are not included in this sheet.
Tracer Summary,"Displays summary information about the tracers identified on the previous sheet. Includes information about mass difference, RT difference, detection frequency, and maximum CV across samples.","This worksheet, at a minimum, should be considered for inclusion in any study QA/QC reports."
Decision Documentation,"Displays all features present in the original input detection matrix along and calculations of the outcomes of both features and sample occurences. Additional columns are present to flag when any sample occurrences, or entire features, are dopped or flagged based on INTERPRET NTA processing. Also displays occurrence counts as total possible, total present in the input detection matrix, and the final counts with and without flags.","Individual sample occurrences also display flags to identify which were removed or flagged, and for what reason. When a numerical value is displayed, it is the blank-subtracted mean peak area found for that sample. A numerical value indicates that the occurrence passed each QA/QC threshold."
Final Occurrence Matrix,"Displays only the features and the sample occurrences that passed INTERPRET NTA filtering criteria. Includes columns for feature-level information (feature ID, mass, retention time) and INTERPRET NTA identifications (tracer match, duplicate, adduct or neutral loss), and INTERPRET NTA calculations (occurrence counts and percentages). All other columns are for displaying peak areas in samples as “Blank_sub_Mean"" values. These peak areas are representative of the steps taken during INTERPRET NTA processing (replicate & CV filtering, MRL checks for non-detects, and blank subtraction) ","Samples identified as the ""Blanks"" for MRL calculations and blank subtraction in your input file are shown here as their raw, unmodified peak areas"
Final Occurrence Matrix (flags),"Shares the same structure as Final Occurrence Matrix but includes numeric values for flagged sample occurrences that passed the replication and MRL thresholds, but failed the CV threshold",The user should use flagged values with caution in all downstream analyses
Chemical results,Displays the annotations of features that have a precursor mass (or formula) match to compound(s) in the DSSTox database,Not described in detail here
