Required column ,Acceptable column names,Description of column contents,Additional comments
Mass,"Mass, mass, MASS","The neutral, monoisotopic mass of a feature. Submitted values should have an appropriate number of decimal places relative to the measurement technique (e.g., at least four for HRMS data)",This mass should be reflective of any upstream data processing software or tools that were used to identify adducts/multimers/other ion forms
m/z ,m/z,"The measured mass-to-charge (m/z) value of a feature. This value should have an appropriate number of decimal places relative to the measurement technique (e.g., at least four for HRMS data)","If a “Mass” column is present, the m/z value will be treated as a pass-through column. If mass is not present this column will be used by INTERPRET NTA (along with the ionization mode) to calculate the feature’s mass. The m/z value will not be reflective of any already identified adducts/multimers/other ion forms from upstream processing"
Retention_Time,"Retention_time, Retention_Time, RETENTION_TIME, rt, RT, Ret._Time","The measured retention time of a feature. This value should be given in units of minutes and have an appropriate number of decimal places relative to the measurement technique (e.g., one or two for LC data)",
Sample or Blank abundance,"For blanks used for MRL determination and blank subtraction: MB, mb, mB, Mb, BLANK, Blank, blank","The measured response of features in each sample or bank, typically given as an integrated peak area","If any blank (e.g., solvent blank) is not desired to used be for MRL determination and blank subtraction, ensure none of the “acceptable column names” are used. Sample responses should not be imputed, normalized, or otherwise transformed prior to processing"
