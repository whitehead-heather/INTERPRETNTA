Name,Definition,Purpose
Trip Blank,"Closed container of laboratory-grade water (or a matched blank matrix) that travels to the field location(s), remaining closed, that undergoes extraction & preparation alongside samples",Identifies contaminants introduced from sampling containers
Field Blank,"Container of laboratory-grade water (or a matched blank matrix) that travels to the field location(s), is opened during sampling, that undergoes extraction & preparation alongside samples",Identifies contaminants introduced during the act of sampling
Equipment Blank,"Container of laboratory-grade water (or a matched blank matrix) that is processed through the same equipment used during sampling, that undergoes extraction & preparation alongside samples","Identifies contaminants introduced by specific tools or steps in sampling (e.g., pumps)"
Method Blank,"Laboratory-grade water (or a matched blank matrix) that undergoes extraction & preparation alongside samples, spiked with internal standards used in the study",Identifies contaminants introduced during sample preparation and measures the extraction efficiency of the sample preparation method without matrix
Laboratory Blank,"Diluent used to prepare final sample extracts, spiked with internal standards used in the study",Measures the response of isotopically-labeled compounds in the same solvent composition as samples (excluding matrix) 
Solvent Blank,"Diluent used to prepare final sample extracts, not spiked with any native or internal standards used in the study","Identifies contaminants present in the diluent or the instrument, due to carryover or contamination of mobile phases"
